<h1 align = "center"><i>Wordle based Discord Bot</i></h1>

Durdle is a Discord bot inspired by the popular internet game [Wordle](https://powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). Each player has six tries to guess a target five-letter word. A new word is generated for every user each day. Durdle is made using `Python`, `MongoDB` and hosted on `Heroku`.

### Durdle Features
- A different word is generated for every user each day.
- The word resets everyday at `0000` hours GMT.
- It provides the meaning and usage of the word (if it is found on the [Word API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)).
- It keeps a count of the times a user played Durdle and their maximum streak of correct guesses.
